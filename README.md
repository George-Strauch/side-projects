# Side-Projects
Small projects I have worked on to help me better understand different tools and languages


## steganography-in-go
My first go project to familiarize myself with the go language.
This is a reimplementation of my [python version](Python-Image-Processing/Steganography.py) of
least significant bit steganography for storing text in images.

See [steganography-in-go/README.md](steganography-in-go/README.md)

## Python-Image-Processing
Project consisting of various computer vision algorithms such as kernel filters,
DFT and steganography.
